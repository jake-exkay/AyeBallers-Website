# AyeBallers Website
Website built in HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/MySQL for the AyeBallers guild on the Hypixel Network (https://hypixel.net/). The website contains interactive leaderboards of guild members for many minigames and is the home of the Paintball tournament leaderboard and event management tools.

## Project Motivation
I created this project for guild members and tournament participants. The aim of this website is to rank guild members in certain minigames and also include overall leaderboards for some games. I decided to extend the website for use during community organised tournaments so players can easily view their ranking.
