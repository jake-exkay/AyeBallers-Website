# AyeBallers Website
Website built in HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/MySQL for the AyeBallers guild on the Hypixel Network (https://hypixel.net/). The website contains interactive leaderboards of guild members for many minigames and is the home of the Paintball tournament leaderboard and event management tools.

## Project Motivation
I created this project for guild members and tournament participants. The aim of this website is to rank guild members in certain minigames and also include overall leaderboards for some games. I decided to extend the website for use during community organised tournaments so players can easily view their ranking.

## Usage and Contributing
The website can be viewed at http://ayeballers.xyz/. I am not currently accepting contributions to the website but this may change in the future. If you encounter any bugs or have any feature requests, please use the "issues" section on the GitHub repository.

## Credits
The website is created using Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/) and uses both the Hypixel (https://api.hypixel.net/) and Mojang (https://api.mojang.com/) API's.
